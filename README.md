# Unusual Containers in C++

A collection of non-standard, high-performance, low-level container data structures written in modern C++.  
Designed for niche use cases, performance optimization, and systems programming.

## First container: Double Buffered Circular Buffer
- Provides contiguous memory view without wraparound logic
- Useful for DSP, rolling window algorithms, GPU uploads

## Planned containers
- Overwriting circular buffer
- Static memory pool linked list
- Cache-optimized deque
